First let's cut A into two parts at a random position i:

      left_A             |        right_A
A[0], A[1], ..., A[i-1]  |  A[i], A[i+1], ..., A[m-1]
Since A has m elements, so there are m+1 kinds of cutting( i = 0 ~ m ). And we know: len(left_A) = i, len(right_A) = m - i . Note: when i = 0 , left_A is empty, and when i = m , right_A is empty.

With the same way, cut B into two parts at a random position j:

      left_B             |        right_B
B[0], B[1], ..., B[j-1]  |  B[j], B[j+1], ..., B[n-1]
Put left_A and left_B into one set, and put right_A and right_B into another set. Let's name them left_part and right_part :

      left_part          |        right_part
A[0], A[1], ..., A[i-1]  |  A[i], A[i+1], ..., A[m-1]
B[0], B[1], ..., B[j-1]  |  B[j], B[j+1], ..., B[n-1]
If we can ensure:

1) len(left_part) == len(right_part)
2) max(left_part) <= min(right_part)
then we divide all elements in {A, B} into two parts with equal length, and one part is always greater than the other. Then median = (max(left_part) + min(right_part))/2.

To ensure these two conditions, we just need to ensure:

(1) i + j == m - i + n - j (or: m - i + n - j + 1)
    if n >= m, we just need to set: i = 0 ~ m, j = (m + n + 1)/2 - i
(2) B[j-1] <= A[i] and A[i-1] <= B[j]
ps.1 For simplicity, I presume A[i-1],B[j-1],A[i],B[j] are always valid even if i=0/i=m/j=0/j=n . I will talk about how to deal with these edge values at last.

ps.2 Why n >= m? Because I have to make sure j is non-nagative since 0 <= i <= m and j = (m + n + 1)/2 - i. If n < m , then j may be nagative, that will lead to wrong result.

So, all we need to do is:

Searching i in [0, m], to find an object `i` that:
    B[j-1] <= A[i] and A[i-1] <= B[j], ( where j = (m + n + 1)/2 - i )
And we can do a binary search following steps described below:

<1> Set imin = 0, imax = m, then start searching in [imin, imax]

<2> Set i = (imin + imax)/2, j = (m + n + 1)/2 - i

<3> Now we have len(left_part)==len(right_part). And there are only 3 situations
     that we may encounter:
    <a> B[j-1] <= A[i] and A[i-1] <= B[j]
        Means we have found the object `i`, so stop searching.
    <b> B[j-1] > A[i]
        Means A[i] is too small. We must `ajust` i to get `B[j-1] <= A[i]`.
        Can we `increase` i?
            Yes. Because when i is increased, j will be decreased.
            So B[j-1] is decreased and A[i] is increased, and `B[j-1] <= A[i]` may
            be satisfied.
        Can we `decrease` i?
            `No!` Because when i is decreased, j will be increased.
            So B[j-1] is increased and A[i] is decreased, and B[j-1] <= A[i] will
            be never satisfied.
        So we must `increase` i. That is, we must ajust the searching range to
        [i+1, imax]. So, set imin = i+1, and goto <2>.
    <c> A[i-1] > B[j]
        Means A[i-1] is too big. And we must `decrease` i to get `A[i-1]<=B[j]`.
        That is, we must ajust the searching range to [imin, i-1].
        So, set imax = i-1, and goto <2>.
When the object i is found, the median is:

max(A[i-1], B[j-1]) (when m + n is odd)
or (max(A[i-1], B[j-1]) + min(A[i], B[j]))/2 (when m + n is even)
